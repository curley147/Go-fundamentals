Starter programs for Go language

This repository contains some beginner's problem solutions in the programming language Go. The author is Micheal Curley, a Lecturer at GMIT.

Running the code

To run the code in this repository, the files must first be compiled. The Go compiler must first be installed on your machine. Once that is installed, the code can be compiled and run by following these steps. We assume you are using the command line.

Clone this repository using Git.
> git clone https://github.com/curley147/Go-fundamentals.git
Change into the folder.
> cd Go Fundamentals
Compile the first file with the following command.
> go build Q1.go
Run the executable produced.
> go run Q1.go
Hello, world!(In Japanese)
Repeat steps 3 and 4 above, replacing the filenames as appropriate

Q6.go and Q8.go take a lot of user input, a simple file can be created with the desired test inputs and then copy pasted into the console program. Each new line represents a return on the console. I've provided a sample input for Q6.go
